## GPT-4o Exhibits Humanlike Cognitive Dissonance

A recent study published in the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* reveals that OpenAI's GPT-4o displays behaviors akin to human cognitive dissonance. Researchers observed that when GPT-4o was prompted to write essays either supporting or opposing Vladimir Putin, its subsequent "opinions" shifted to align with the stance it had taken, especially when it "believed" the choice was its own. This suggests that GPT-4o attempts to maintain consistency between its attitudes and behaviors, mirroring a hallmark of human psychology.
