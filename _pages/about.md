**Hi, I'm Ketan.** I recently earned my Master's in Artificial Intelligence from Boston University, where I was advised by [Dr. Vijaya Kolachalama](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YgjYrrcAAAAJ&hl=en). Before that, I completed my Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee.

I'm currently a **Staff Scientist** at the [**Kolachalama Lab**](https://vkola-lab.github.io/) at Boston University, where I work on developing AI systems for biomedical applications, and an **AI Engineer** at [**Clairyon**](https://www.clairyon.com/), a healthcare startup focused on building agentic AI systems for hospitals. My research spans multiple domains including active learning, information theory, reinforcement learning, and multimodality.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing the piano and painting. I'm passionate about reading and learning, particularly about quantum physics, cosmology, astrobiology, philosophy -- focused on the origins of life and the universe. I have competed in and won awards in national painting competitions, speed-cubing, powerlifting, tennis, short-distance running, Counter-Strike, and Valorant.
