Hi, I’m Ketan. I recently graduated from Boston University
with a master’s in Artificial Intelligence and previously
completed my bachelor’s in Electrical Engineering from the
Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee.

My research fundamentally covers learning with limited
data. More specifically, I worked on Active Feature
Acquisition, a problem that revolves around reinforcement
learning,  information theory, and explainable AI. Besides
that, I worked on improving the robustness of transformers
to missing features in data. I also worked on improving
long-prompt alignment in diffusion models and researched
humanlike cognition in Large Language Models (LLMs).


Outside of research, I love playing the piano, painting,
speed-cubing, powerlifting, tennis, sprinting, and
counterstrike.
