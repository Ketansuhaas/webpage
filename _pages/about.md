**Hi, I‚Äôm Ketan.** I recently earned my Master‚Äôs in Artificial Intelligence from Boston University, where I was advised by Dr. Vijaya Kolachalama. Before that, I completed my Bachelor‚Äôs in Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee.

I'm currently a **Staff Scientist** at the **Kolachalama Lab** at Boston University and an **AI Engineer** at **Clairyon**, a healthcare startup focused on building agentic AI systems for hospitals.

## Research:
* Active Feature Acquisition, which combines reinforcement learning, information theory, and explainable AI.
* Improving long-prompt alignment in diffusion models.
* Enhancing transformer robustness to missing features.
* Exploring humanlike cognition in large language models (LLMs).

## Industry:
* Building and scaling agentic AI systems.
* Deploying AI solutions on cloud platforms.
* Automating internal workflows using generative AI agents.

Outside of research, I enjoy playing the piano, painting, speed-cubing, powerlifting, tennis, sprinting, and playing Counter-Strike.
