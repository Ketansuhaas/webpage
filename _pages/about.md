**Hi, I‚Äôm Ketan.** I recently earned my Master‚Äôs in Artificial Intelligence from Boston University, where I was advised by Dr. Vijaya Kolachalama. Before that, I completed my Bachelor‚Äôs in Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee.

I'm currently a **Staff Scientist** at the **Kolachalama Lab** at Boston University and an **AI Engineer** at **Clairyon**, a healthcare startup focused on building agentic AI systems for hospitals.

My research broadly centers on **learning from limited data**. Specifically, I‚Äôve worked on:

* **Active Feature Acquisition**, which combines reinforcement learning, information theory, and explainable AI.
* Enhancing **transformer robustness** to missing features.
* Improving **long-prompt alignment** in diffusion models.
* Exploring **humanlike cognition** in large language models (LLMs).

Outside of research, I enjoy playing the piano, painting, speed-cubing, powerlifting, tennis, sprinting, and playing Counter-Strike.
