**Hi, I'm Ketan.** I'm an AI researcher and engineer passionate about advancing machine learning and artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems in healthcare and scientific discovery. I recently earned my Master's in Artificial Intelligence from Boston University, where I was advised by [Dr. Vijaya Kolachalama](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YgjYrrcAAAAJ&hl=en). Before that, I completed my Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee.

I'm currently a **Staff Scientist** at the [**Kolachalama Lab**](https://vkola-lab.github.io/) at Boston University, where I work on developing AI systems for biomedical applications, and an **AI Engineer** at [**Clairyon**](https://www.clairyon.com/), a healthcare startup focused on building agentic AI systems for hospitals. My research spans multiple domains including active learning, reinforcement learning, and multimodality.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing the piano, reading about cosmology & philosophy, painting and singing. I have also competed in and won awards in national painting competitions, speed-cubing, powerlifting, tennis, sprinting, Counter-Strike, and Valorant.
