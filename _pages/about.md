**Hi, I‚Äôm Ketan.** I recently earned my Master‚Äôs in Artificial Intelligence from Boston University, where I was advised by Dr. Vijaya Kolachalama. Before that, I completed my Bachelor‚Äôs in Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee.

I'm currently a **Staff Scientist** at the [**Kolachalama Lab**](https://vkola-lab.github.io/) at Boston University and an **AI Engineer** at [**Clairyon**](https://www.clairyon.com/), a healthcare startup focused on building agentic AI systems for hospitals.

## üßë‚Äçüî¨ Research Interests

**Broad Areas:**
- Multi-agent systems for advancing scientific discovery
- Vision-language models in neuropathology and biomedical imaging
- Multimodal foundation models
- Active Feature Acquisition strategies
- Aligning text-to-image generative models
- Investigating human-like cognition and reasoning in LLMs

**Core Technical Domains:**
- Reinforcement Learning and sequential decision-making
- Information Theory and uncertainty quantification
- Explainable and interpretable AI
- Active Learning methodologies
- Diffusion models for generative tasks
- Graph Neural Networks and relational modeling
- Large Language Models: architectures, alignment, and applications


## Industry:
* Building and scaling agentic AI systems at scale.
* Deploying AI solutions on cloud platforms.
* Automating internal workflows using AI agents.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing the piano, painting, speed-cubing, powerlifting, tennis, sprinting, and playing Counter-Strike.
